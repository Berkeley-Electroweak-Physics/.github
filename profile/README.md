# Overview  

This organization contains supporting code and data for electroweak physics projects involving UC Berkeley and collaborating groups.
Current projects are related to understanding dark matter detection and muon to electron conversion experiments.

# MuonBridge: Matching of BSM models to a Nucleon Level Effective Theory of $\mu \rightarrow e$ Conversion

This project requires access to the following additional repositories.   An automated script in MuonBridge will clone and configure them with compatible versions.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; [MuonConverter](https://github.com/Berkeley-Electroweak-Physics/MuonConverter) for connecting beyond standard model theories to the non-relativistic nucleon level effective theory in Mu2e_NRET.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; [Mu2e_NRET](https://github.com/Berkeley-Electroweak-Physics/Mu2e_NRET)  for computing $\mu\rightarrow e$ reaction rates and branching ratios.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; [Elastic repository](https://github.com/Berkeley-Electroweak-Physics/Elastic) for one-body density matrices.

# Mu2e_NRET: A Nucleon Level Effective Theory for Muon to Electron Conversion  

This project contains python and mathematica code for computing decay rates and branching
ratios for muon to electron conversion experiments with different target isotopes.   The
formulation can be non-relativistic or relativistic (including the lower components for the muon)

[Mu2E](https://github.com/Berkeley-Electroweak-Physics/Mu2e_NRET)  

This project requires access to the [Elastic repository](https://github.com/Berkeley-Electroweak-Physics/Elastic) for one-body density matrices.

# Elastic: One-Body Density Matrices for Common Experimental Targets  

We have computed one-body density matrices using BIGSTICK for many commonly used isotopes for
dark matter and muon to electron conversion experiments.
