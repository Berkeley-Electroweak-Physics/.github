# Overview  

This organization contains supporting code and data for electroweak physics projects involving UC Berkeley and collaborating groups.
Current projects are related to understanding dark matter detection and muon to electron conversion experiments.

<!--
# Matching of BSM models to the Nucleon Level Effective Theory  

This project requires access to additional repositories here  
&nbsp;&nbsp; [Mu2E](https://github.com/Berkeley-Electroweak-Physics/Mu2e)  for computing $\mu\rightarrow e$ reaction rates and branching ratios.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; [Elastic repository](https://github.com/Berkeley-Electroweak-Physics/Elastic) for one-body density matrices.

# A Nucleon Level Effective Theory for Muon to Electron Conversion  

This project contains python and mathematica code for computing decay rates and branching
ratios for muon to electron conversion experiments with different target isotopes.   The
formulation can be non-relativistic or relativistic (including the lower components for the muon)

[Mu2E](https://github.com/Berkeley-Electroweak-Physics/Mu2e)  

This project requires access to the [Elastic repository](https://github.com/Berkeley-Electroweak-Physics/Elastic) for one-body density matrices.

# One body Density Matrices for Common Experimental Targets  

We have computed one-body density matrices using BIGSTICK for many commonly used isotopes for
dark matter and muon to electron conversion experiments.
