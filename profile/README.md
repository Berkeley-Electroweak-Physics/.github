# Overview  

This organization contains supporting code and data for electroweak physics projects involving UC Berkeley and collaborating groups.
Current projects are related to understanding dark matter detection and muon to electron conversion experiments.

# One body Density Matrices for Common Experimental Targets  

We have computed one-body density matrices using BIGSTICK for many commonly used isotopes for
dark matter and muon to electron conversion experiments.

# A Nucleon Level Effective Theory for Muon to Electron Conversion  

[Mu2E](https://github.com/Berkeley-Electroweak-Physics/Mu2e)  

This project requires access to the [Elastic repository](https://github.com/Berkeley-Electroweak-Physics/Elastic) for one-body density matrices.
